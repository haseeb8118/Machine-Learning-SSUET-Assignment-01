ASSIGNMENT-01:
Question No.01

(i) How the ensemble leaning helpful for avoiding overfitting. Discuss with suitable example.

(ii) Implement and compare the performance of following algorithms for classification:
  (i) KNN
  (ii) Na√Øve Bayes
  (iii) Decision tree
  (iv) Random forest
  (v) Logistic regression

Download public dataset of heart disease from Kaggle, GitHub or UCI Machine Learning repository. Implement
and evaluate performance of each algorithm using accuracy, precision, recall, F1- score and AUC curve metrics.
Bonus: Implement a simple ensemble method (e.g. bagging or boosting) using one of the above algorithms and
evaluate its performance.

Note: You can use Python with scikit-learn and TensorFlow libraries to implement the algorithms and evaluate their performance.

ASSIGNMENT-02:
Question: Apply YOLO to the given image containing multiple objects. Use the following settings:
  1. Anchor points: 5
  2. Anchor boxes: 3
  3. NMS threshold: 0.5
  4. Confidence threshold: 0.8

Image: [Insert image with multiple objects, e.g., cars, pedestrians, bicycles]

Task:
  i. Preprocess the image and prepare it for YOLO input.
  ii. Apply YOLO to detect objects in the image.
  iii. Implement NMS to filter out duplicate detections.
  iv. Visualize the detection results, including bounding boxes and class labels.
  v. Calculate the mAP (mean Average Precision) for the detection results.

Requirements:
  i. Use a latest YOLO variant and implement it using a deep learning framework (e.g., PyTorch, TensorFlow).
  ii. Code should be written in Python.
  iii. Provide a detailed report explaining the steps taken, results, and discussions.

Grading criteria:
  - Accuracy of object detection
  - Effective use of NMS and anchor points
  - Code quality and organization
  - Clarity of report and results
