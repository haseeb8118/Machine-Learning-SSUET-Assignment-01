Question No.01

(i) How the ensemble leaning helpful for avoiding overfitting. Discuss with suitable example.

(ii) Implement and compare the performance of following algorithms for classification:
  (i) KNN
  (ii) Na√Øve Bayes
  (iii) Decision tree
  (iv) Random forest
  (v) Logistic regression

Download public dataset of heart disease from Kaggle, GitHub or UCI Machine Learning repository. Implement
and evaluate performance of each algorithm using accuracy, precision, recall, F1- score and AUC curve metrics.
Bonus: Implement a simple ensemble method (e.g. bagging or boosting) using one of the above algorithms and
evaluate its performance.

Note: You can use Python with scikit-learn and TensorFlow libraries to implement the algorithms and evaluate
their performance,
