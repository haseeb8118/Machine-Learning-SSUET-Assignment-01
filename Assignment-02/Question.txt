Question: Apply YOLO to the given image containing multiple objects. Use the following settings:
  1. Anchor points: 5
  2. Anchor boxes: 3
  3. NMS threshold: 0.5
  4. Confidence threshold: 0.8

Image: [Insert image with multiple objects, e.g., cars, pedestrians, bicycles]

Task:
  i. Preprocess the image and prepare it for YOLO input.
  ii. Apply YOLO to detect objects in the image.
  iii. Implement NMS to filter out duplicate detections.
  iv. Visualize the detection results, including bounding boxes and class labels.
  v. Calculate the mAP (mean Average Precision) for the detection results.

Requirements:
  i. Use a latest YOLO variant and implement it using a deep learning framework (e.g., PyTorch, TensorFlow).
  ii. Code should be written in Python.
  iii. Provide a detailed report explaining the steps taken, results, and discussions.

Grading criteria:
  - Accuracy of object detection
  - Effective use of NMS and anchor points
  - Code quality and organization
  - Clarity of report and results
