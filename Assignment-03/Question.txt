Q1. Apply transfer learning algorithms to detect diseases like tuberculosis (TB) in X-Ray images and brain tumors in MRI images and analyze the results. Analyze all results

Dataset:
  - Chest X-Ray Images (TB)
  - Brain MRI (Tumor Segmentation)
  - (Dataset download: Kaggle, GitHub, UCI repository)

Specific Requirements:
  1. Data Preprocessing:
   - Split each dataset into training (80%) and validation sets (20%).
   - Normalize image pixel values between 0 and 1.
   - Resize images to 256x256 pixels.
  2. Transfer Learning:
   - Use each of the following pre-trained models as a starting point:
   - ResNet50
   - DenseNet121
   - InceptionV3
   - Fine-tune the models by adjusting the following hyperparameters:
   - Learning rate (0.001, 0.01, 0.1)
   - Batch size (8, 16,, 32)
   - Number of epochs (50)
  3. Performance Evaluation:
   - Calculate the following metrics for each model on the validation set:
   - Accuracy
   - Precision
   - Recall
   - F1-score
   - AUC-ROC
  4. Comparative Analysis:
   - Create a table comparing the performance metrics of each model for both datasets.
   - Plot the ROC curves for each model.
   - Discuss the strengths and weaknesses of each model and identify the best-performing model for each disease.

Deliverables:
  i. A Python script or Jupyter Notebook implementing the task.
  ii. A table comparing the performance metrics of each model for both datasets.
  iii. A plot (e.g., bar chart or ROC curve) visualizing the performance comparison.
  iv. A brief report (4-5 pages) discussing the results, strengths, and weaknesses of each model, and concluding with the best-performing model for each disease.

Evaluation Criteria:
  1. Accuracy and efficiency of the transfer learning approach.
  2. Effectiveness of hyperparameter tuning.
  3. Thoroughness of the comparative analysis.
  4. Clarity and organization of the deliverables.

Additional Requirements:
  - Use techniques like data augmentation, regularization, or ensemble methods to improve model performance.
  - Explore the use of transfer learning with different architectures
  - Discuss the clinical implications and potential applications of the best-performing models in medical diagnosis.
